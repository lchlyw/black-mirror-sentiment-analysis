It's, what, 12 mil just to enter?

168
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,520
What kind of bike time
is that? Six months?

169
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:27,525
Yeah, but...

170
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,805
I'm hand to mouth.

171
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,160
I know people save and
stuff to get onto that stage

172
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:35,480
and then there's what Selma
did. But, you know what?

173
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:36,565
I'd rather not give myself...

174
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I'd rather not give myself...
Yeah, but I'll gift it to you.

175
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
The full 12, I'll gift it.

176
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,885
Don't be ridiculous!

177
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,680
Seriously, I've got it spare.

178
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,117
You've got 12 mil spare?

179
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:58,356
My brother left it me.

180
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,560
Own a channel, does he?

181
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:03,177
No, he...

182
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,725
He died.

183
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,680
He... He died last year,

184
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:11,565
so it got transferred to me.

185
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Just over six months'
worth, but I've kept it.

186
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,285
Why don't you spend it on you, then?

187
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,760
And buy what? Some new
shoes for my doppel to wear?

188
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:25,257
I don't know, upgrade your MOS...

189
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,806
Or get a Fat Attack season pass?

190
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,285
Buy one of those wall buddies.

191
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,725
The new ones that talk to you after
shutting and solve your problems.

192
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,540
They guide your dreams, like gurus.
It's amazing, really, what they can do.

193
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:41,320
A mirror plug-in? That shows me how I
look as a werewolf? What's the point?

194
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:42,325
I know it can be quite funny.

195
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,760
I know it can be quite
funny. It's all just stuff.

196
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,845
It's...

197
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,880
It's stuff, it's confetti, it's...

198
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,240
You've got something real.

199
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,885
What better to spend it on?

200
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,360
You heard me singing in a toilet.

201
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,805
Is that real?

202
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
More than anything
that's happened all year.

203
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I can't take that kind
of clockage off someone.

204
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,600
It's 12 mils, no way.

205
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,600
Let me do this.

206
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I... I look around here, I just...

207
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
I just want something real to happen.

208
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Just once.

209
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,965
I'd mess up.

210
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,605
You wouldn't. I don't care anyway.

211
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,680
I'll go with you. I'll
be able to force you.

212
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:43,560
I'll force you to go.

213
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,440
It's tomorrow.

214
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:50,440
Come on!

215
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Say yes.

216
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I'll go as far as to say, "OK."

217
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:08,240
Which proves acceptable.

218
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Thank God for that.

219
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,800
Walking away now.

220
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,285
You loon!

221
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I can live with it!

222
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I'd love to fucking ruin that and all.

223
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,360
What?

224
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:28,400
15?

225
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,040
A flippin' joke...

226
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,845
'New from Wraith Babes.

227
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,800
'The hottest girls in
the nastiest situations. '

228
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:31,800
Oh, yeah! Ooh!

229
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Can't believe I'm doing this.

230
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
I am doing this.

231
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,800
I can't be doing this.

232
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,280
Can you trade it back?

233
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:03,117
The ticket?

234
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:04,885
Don't be mad.

235
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,040
It's a lot of pressure to
put someone under, you know.

236
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:11,160
Don't think I'm not grateful.
But it's, it's just...

237
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,917
You're babbling.

238
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm babbling.

239
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I made you this.

240
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,640
You never get to keep
them more than a day,

241
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:33,640
but there it is, anyway.

242
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,525
It folds flat.

243
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,560
So you can keep them in your waistband.

244
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Thank you.

245
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
It's, you know...

246
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:55,800
something.

247
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Face the screen, please.

248
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,480
Is he your Friends
And Family allocation?

249
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,680
Hand, please.

250
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,405
Oh!

251
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,125
That's not permanent, is it?

252
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,240
That's not permanent, is
it? Oh, no. Two months max.

253
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:45,240
Round to the right,
and through the scanner.

254
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,005
Where do we go now?

255
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,280
Where do we go now? You wait here.

256
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,280
How long?

257
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,480
So, what do we do?

258
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:20,757
I don't know.

259
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,965
Hey, hey, hey.

260
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hey, hey, hey. Fuck off.

261
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,365
Her with the dark hair?

262
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

263
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:35,045
Yup. OK. Move.

264
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,240
They want to preview you.

265
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:39,325
What?

266
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,520
What? Preview. Come on.

267
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:41,285
He's with me.

268
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,960
He's with me. Hand?

269
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:46,600
Show me your hand.

270
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,565
OK. You, too.

271
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,920
OK. You, too. That's not fair.
She's new. That's not fair.

272
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,885
I don't pick the order.

273
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,445
I've waited here all week,
and she's just walked in.

274
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,400
Everyone will get seen
eventually. I don't pick the order.

275
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,845
But I'm a good singer.

276
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
I can sing. I'm a good singer, I am.

277
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,597
Stand aside.

278
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:09,640
It's not fair!

279
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,805
Next lot.

280
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Stand there.

281
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
Would you like to be
as big as Salma one day?

282
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,805
Erm...

283
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,280
Yeah, I mean...

284
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,685
Could you say that

285
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
as a self-contained
sentence into that screen?

286
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,360
I guess I'd like to be
as big as Salma one day.

287
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,320
OK. Proceed to stage area.

288
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:40,320
Are we done?

289
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,560
Both performing?

290
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:44,245
Just her.

291
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:44,965
And what are you?

292
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
And what are you? Singer.

293
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:47,397
Compliance?

294
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,565
No, thanks.

295
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,500
A
- ha. Yes, thanks! It's compulsory for all contestants.

296
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:54,365
More to the point, it'll
stop you puking with nerves.

297
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,325
More to the point, it'll stop you
puking with nerves. She's got to perform.

298
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,560
More to the point, it'll stop you puking
with nerves. She's got to perform. Well, mmm

299
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,560
Look, just sip it, you'll be fine.

300
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Just a touch of light foam. It'll pass.

301
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,365
Make the most of it.

302
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,445
You can't get this stuff anywhere else.

303
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,200
You can't get this stuff
anywhere else. You OK?

304
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:10,845
Yeah.

305
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah. You OK?

306
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,725
Yeah. Just, erm...

307
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,360
I don't know. Things
are just wider apart.

308
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:21,365
I'm fine.

309
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,540
I'm fine. Really?

310
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:26,627
Yeah, I'm fine.

311
00:30:26,662 --> 00:30:29,680
Right. You're on.

312
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,520
A little closer, please.

313
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Little closer.

314
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Into the light, love.

315
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,360
And who're we looking at here?

316
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,405
Abi Khan.

317
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,760
What are you going to
do for us today, Abi?

318
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,277
I'm going to sing.

319
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:14,725
You speak up, love.

320
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,080
You speak up, love. We don't bite.

321
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:20,045
I'm going to sing.

322
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,720
Hey, would you mind
lifting up your top for me?

323
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,685
Can you take off your top?

324
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,640
I want to check out those titties.

326
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,000
Come on. Mucho feranto.

327
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:37,805
Ah! No titties?

328
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,805
She says she's here to sing.

329
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,160
I got to see those titties, though.

330
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,557
Come on, girl.

331
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:45,996

That was...

362
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,005
.. without a doubt...

363
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,840
.. probably the best piece of
singing we've had this season.

364
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,320
Yes! Well done!

365
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Fair play.

366
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,400
But I have to say...

367
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,440
No. No, no, no. I have to say,

368
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:48,645
actually,

369
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,645
I'm with Rafe on this one.

370
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,600
Good though your voice is
- and it is good.

371
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,520
It's not the most magical
sound in the world.

372
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,485
It's just... good.

373
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,940
I don't think anyone's
really hearing it.

374
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,360
Certainly not the guys in the audience.

375
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,240
These looks you got going
on kind of get in the way.

376
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,320
Men will want you. Women will hate you.

377
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:14,937
All the time you're on stage.

378
00:35:14,972 --> 00:35:17,520
Couldn't help picturing you.

379
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,805
In an erotic scenario.

380
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Getting pretty turned on, if I'm honest.

381
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,645
Right.

382
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,685
You've got this pure beauty

383
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,525
What seems to be a knockout figure.

384
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
And this sort of interesting
innocence going on.

385
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,560
That's something I think
Rafe's erotica channels

386
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,885
could really play with.

387
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,440
Absolutely. That's what I thought

388
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,840
the moment I saw you.

389
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,285
The moment.

390
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,560
I'd watch. I don't know
a man here who wouldn't.

391
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,800
To be honest, some of
us girls might join you.

392
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:58,056
Get off me!

393
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:00,245
Don't! Abi!

394
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,365
No! Abi! Abi!

395
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
I don't think that's quite...

396
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,200
You will never have to
pedal again. Not one minute.

397
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,485
We could really work with you.

398
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,240
Last year we had
singers, singers, singers.

399
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,565
So many singers.

400
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,720
So, to be a singer you
have to be truly exceptional

401
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:26,840
There's just no slots left
for an above average singer.

402
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,560
Not for the next few
years, at least. Charity?

403
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:32,737
No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

404
00:36:32,772 --> 00:36:35,845
Listen. We said, right from the start.

405
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,440
We'll go with something
different this season.

406
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:42,125
That's why he's on the panel!

407
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,000
She would be a star on our stream.

408
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,817
A star.

409
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:48,565
On his...

410
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,245
You're furniture, at best.

411
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,160
Forget about all the shame,
and all that ppht-ppht-tew.

412
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:56,565
We medicate against that.

413
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,765
You will have pleasure forever.

414
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,840
Realistically, sweetheart, it is that,

415
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,725
or the bike.

416
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,605
I, I don't think...

417
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,325
This is starting to annoy me.

418
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Who do you think is
powering that spotlight?

419
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,500
Millions of people. That's who.

420
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,007
All of them, out there, right now.

421
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,445
Putting in an honest day on the bike,

422
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,080
while you stand in the
light they're generating

423
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,637
and dither.

424
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,125
You know what?

425
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,160
They would give anything. Do
anything to be where you are now.

426
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,085
Am I right?!

427
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,120
You want to cock a snook at all
that, as though it's nothing.

428
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,540
As though they're nothing.

429
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:52,367
And that makes me sick.

430
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:55,125
But, you know what?

431
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,125
Maybe you do belong on the bike.

432
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Because you don't seem to be
very willing to step off it.

433
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,605
I do want to.

434
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,645
We have a decision?

435
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

436
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,080
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

437
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,100
I suppose.

438
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,560
Woo-hoo-hoo!

499
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,360
We're going to preview, all right?
Want to follow me in the back?

500
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,080
You're a prick!

501
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,640
Next, lot.

502
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:24,720
Stand there!

503
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,960
So what are you, a magician?

504
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:30,325
An entertainer.

505
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,360
Could you say that down the screen
as a self-contained sentence?

506
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I'm an entertainer.

507
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,600
Ah, before you go on, you
need to drink a compliance.

508
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:48,405
They give me one back there.

509
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,120
They give me one back
there. Really? Oh, OK.

510
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,720
Well, in that case, you are good to...

511
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:56,720
go.

512
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,220
Who are you?

513
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:11,605
Bing Madsen.

514
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,600
What are you planning to do for us?

515
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:15,485
What the fuck?!

516
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,280
What the fuck?! 'A
sort of performance. '

517
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,320
A sort of performance?

518
00:50:19,355 --> 00:50:21,045
Yes.

519
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,800
Mmm! Man of mystery!

520
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:27,800
Hmm.

521
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,040
Well, I suppose we'd better see it.

522
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:33,925
OK.

523
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,040
Knob'ead!

524
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:18,880
Fucking cock!

525
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Stop or I'll do it. This is a main
artery. Keep walking, you kill me.

526
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,080
No-one stops me till
I've said my piece.

527
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:42,017
Then you can do what you like.

528
00:51:42,052 --> 00:51:43,885
Man, just fucking kill yourself.

529
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,800
Get heavy on me, I swear to God,
I kick your ass back to life,

530
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:48,880
just so I could cut
your goddamn head off.

531
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:54,880
Go on!

532
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,680
I think we should let him speak.

533
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,040
Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak!

534
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,920
Let's hear what he has to say.

535
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,696
Well?

536
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:13,565
Come on.

537
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,960
Got our attention, as requested.

538
00:52:15,995 --> 00:52:19,960
What do you want to say?

539
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,480
Have you prepared a speech, is that it?

540
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,885
Speak!

541
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,200
I haven't got a speech.
I didn't plan words.

542
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,565
I didn't even try to...

543
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,160
I just knew I had to
get here, to stand here,

544
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:36,605
and I wanted you to listen.

545
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,760
To really listen, not just pull
a face like you're listening,

546
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:41,365
like you do the rest of the time.

547
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,820
A face that you're feeling
instead of processing.

548
00:52:43,855 --> 00:52:46,205
You pull a face, and
poke it towards the stage,

549
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,240
and we lah-di-dah, we sing
and dance and tumble around.

550
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,005
And all you see up
here, it's not people,

551
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,620
you don't see people up
here, it's all fodder.

552
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:58,165
And the faker the fodder,
the more you love it,

553
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,820
because fake fodder's the
only thing that works any more.

554
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:03,440
It's all that we can stomach.
Actually, not quite all.

555
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,760
Real pain, real viciousness,
that, we can take.

556
00:53:05,795 --> 00:53:07,445
Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole.

557
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,320
We laugh ourselves feral,
because we've earned the right,

558
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,720
we've done cell time and
he's slacking, the scum,

559
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:13,725
so ha-ha-ha
at him!

560
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,320
Because we're so out of
our minds with desperation,

561
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:18,685
we don't know any better.

562
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,920
All we know is fake
fodder and buying shit.

563
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:22,685
That's how we speak to each other,

564
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,240
how we express
ourselves, is buying shit.

565
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:26,325
What, I have a dream?

566
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,960
The peak of our dreams is a new app
for our Dopple, it doesn't exist!

567
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:32,045
It's not even there!

568
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,805
We buy shit that's not even there.

569
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,040
Show us something real and free
and beautiful. You couldn't.

570
00:53:37,075 --> 00:53:38,597
Yeah? It'd break us.

571
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,116
We're too numb for it.

572
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,565
I might as well choke.

573
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,605
It's only so much wonder we can bear.

574
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,640
When you find any wonder whatsoever,
you dole it out in meagre portions.

575
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Only then until it's augmented, packaged,
and pumped through 10,000 preassigned filters

576
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,240
till it's nothing more than a
meaningless series of lights,

577
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,640
while we ride day in
day out, going where?

578
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:01,405
Powering what?

579
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,320
All tiny cells and tiny
screens and bigger cells

580
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,245
and bigger screens and fuck you!

581
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,165
Fuck you, that's what it boils down to.

582
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Fuck you for sitting there
and slowly making things worse.

583
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,520
Fuck you and your spotlight
and your sanctimonious faces.

584
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,797
Fuck you all for thinking the one thing

585
00:54:19,832 --> 00:54:22,005
I came close to never meant anything.

586
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,040
For oozing around it and crushing
it into a bone, into a joke.

587
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,440
One more ugly joke in
a kingdom of millions.

588
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,045
Fuck you for happening.

589
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Fuck you for me, for us, for everyone.

590
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,880
Fuck you!

591
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,560
That was, without a doubt,

592
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,640
the most heartfelt thing
I've seen on this stage

593
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,560
since Hotshot began!

594
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,480
Brilliant!

595
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,165
You...

596
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,360
you're so articulating something we all,

597
00:55:23,395 --> 00:55:26,160
and I mean everyone in this hall,

598
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:28,445
something we all agree on.

599
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,040
Even though we may not
comprehend all of it.

600
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:35,600
I think I'm right in
saying we do feel it.

601
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:37,925
Even me.

602
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,040
I know you've got me
down as this creature.

603
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:44,005
You know, hey...

604
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,520
I get where you're coming from.

605
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:47,997
I like your stuff.

606
00:55:48,032 --> 00:55:49,405
It's not stuff.

607
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,685
It's truth. Am I right?

608
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,720
Your truth, admittedly,
but truth nonetheless.

609
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,045
And you're right.

610
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Authenticity is in
woefully short supply.

611
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,880
I'd like to hear you talk again.

612
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,645
How so?

613
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,925
The slot on one of my streams

614
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,960
where you can talk just like that.

615
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,605
I'd watch it.

616
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,640
It was such great passion.

617
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,520
He's a'right. You're a
little hot there, bud.

618
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:33,640
That throat cutting thing? Neat gimmick.

619
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,717
What do you say?

620
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:37,760
30 minutes twice a week?

621

Do it, do it, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!

622

Do it, do it, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!

624
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:58,605
Go on, you bastard.

625
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,640
Do it, do it, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!

626
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,540
Beats the bike.

627
