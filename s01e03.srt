1
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:21,069
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

2
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,387
Thank you.

3
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:23,906
OK, little speech time.

4
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:26,637
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

5
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,383
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

6
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:32,023
It is much more of a...

7
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,477
treasure hunt for the gold?

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,655
Shit sinks.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,437
But also, cream floats.

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:41,199
Yes, yes, I see that.

11
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:44,014
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in ...

12
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,438
and your office could
be at the centre for ...

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,877
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

14
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:51,164
Retrospective...

15
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,990
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

16
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:57,803
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

17
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,716
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,237
And morally?

19
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:07,971
Yep.

20
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,077
Sure.

21
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,889
Yeah, yeah, right.

22
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,550
Are you?

23
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,590
Totally, yeah.

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,637
Yes.

25
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,454
OK, Liam, look,

26
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:25,091
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

27
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,274
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

28
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,346
with personnel, maybe... next week.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,797
Well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

30
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:35,977
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

31
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:39,822
But I have to ask you this ...
they're not going to hit anything

32
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:41,787
to freak us out, are they?

33
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,663
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

34
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,647
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

35
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:51,419
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

36
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:58,247
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

37
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:04,194
OK, thank you.

38
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,476
Airport, please.

39
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,842

40
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,110

We really hope to... look forward

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,574
Sorry!

52
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,564
Mr Foxwell.

53
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,353
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,509
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

55
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:12,159
That's great.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,886
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

57
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,027
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

58
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,589
Look at what?

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,899
That!

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,436
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

61
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,743
Seriously?

62
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,357
Yes, seriously!

63
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,519
This is a five-star suite.

64
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,375
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

65
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:38,479
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,559
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

67
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,460
Thanks, Jonas!

68
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,928
Fuck off.

69
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,534
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

70
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:57,557
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

71
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,573
That's right, yes, hi, Liam.

72
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,525
Hi... Hi again.

73
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,492
Hello.

74
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,029
Lucy ... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

75
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,599
Liam!

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,905
Great.

77
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,479
Liam, yes.

78
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,239
Come in.
Thank you.

79
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,693
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,119
Where's Fi been hiding you?

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,037
You know, in our house.

82
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,262
We didn't know ... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

83
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,115
It was over quicker than I thought.

84
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,860
Sorry, hello.

85
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,829
Let's get you a drink.
Beer OK?

86
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,533
Lovely, thank you.

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,694
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

88
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,814
OK, thank you.

89
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,119
Hi.

90
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,743
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

91
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,424
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

92
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,833
- Hi.
- Hello.

93
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,755
So, how was the appraisal?

94
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:15,319
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

95
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,047
But good?

96
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,521
Well...

97
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,585
- Later?
- Later.

98
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,606
OK.

99
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,734
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

100
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,166
Hey.

101
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,434
Jonas, this is...

102
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,457
- Liam ...
- Jonas.

103
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,479
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,679
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,351
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

106
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,484
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

107
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,478
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

108
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

109
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:44,824
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,976
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

111
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,199
Well she's like that.

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,606
Yeah, tell me about it.

113
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,113
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

114
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,325
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's...

115
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,639
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

116
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,625
And Jeff.

117
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,963
Jeff and Fi...

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,439
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

119
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,225
Mad old days.

120
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,917
Before we started up the Kings.

121
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,837
So, yeah...

122
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:24,635
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

123
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,962
Appraisal.

124
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,239
How'd it go?

125
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,637
Good.

126
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,873
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

127
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,232
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,525
Let's have a look.

129
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,740
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

130
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,277
Yeah, great.

131
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:42,411
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

132
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,550
Come on...

133
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,677
It could be fun, we could...

134
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,727
vote!

135
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,885
- Paul?
- Yeah?

136
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,995
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

137
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:53,601
Right, OK.

138
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,275
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

139
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,397
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

140
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,679
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,843
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

142
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,319
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

143
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,599
so let's just drop it, yeah?

144
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,940
Have a cool time.

145
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,119
Time to eat!

146
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,566
It's ready.

147
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,824
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

148
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,672
It's been too long, too long.

149
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,518
Fi.

150
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:31,309
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

151
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,040
He's one of the old crowd.

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,631
I think I said.

153
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,578
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,880
- You know, if you're not in the mood,
we can go. - No, no, I'm fine.

155
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,913
Sure?

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,618
Hey!

157
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,643
Sync and corrected by APOLLO
www.addic7ed.com

158
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,888
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

159
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,049
Thank you.

160
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,209
I've, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

161
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,129
Jonas has had a tough one.

162
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,609
Was it bad?

163
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,850
Yeah.

164
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:25,685
Yeah, we were in the middle
of planning is all

165
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,863
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

166
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,883
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

167
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,449
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

168
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,489
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

169
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,750
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

170
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,627
So, everybody, this is Helen.

171
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,002
Helen, Jonas.

172
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:49,525
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,611
And everyone!

174
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,285
- Hi!
- Help yourself.

175
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,209
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

176
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,809
Are they? Shit!

177
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:01,912
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

178
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:06,169
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

179
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,289
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

180
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,289
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

181
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,437
The problem is the
more that you pay

182
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:19,649
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Yeah, we loved it!",

183
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,449
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

184
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,527
"and only just having
one other person"

185
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,845
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

186
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,962
Would you say you loved her, though?

187
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:40,835
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

188
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,273
You know what it's like early on.

189
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,409
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

190
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,569
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

191
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,289
that just fit together
really fucking well.

192
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,925
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

193
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,129
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

194
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,728
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

195
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,849
hot times in earlier relationships!

196
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,162
Easy!

197
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:04,578
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

198
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:05,974
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

199
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,236
What, right now?

200
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:13,889
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

201
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,889
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

202
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:21,762
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

203
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,680
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

204
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:29,741
Come on...

205
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,409
Come on, guys.

206
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,169
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

207
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,769
rifling through our greatest hits

208
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,845
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

209
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,271
Not me.

210
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,312
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

211
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:48,869
No shit!

212
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,169
Was that a political thing?

213
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,689
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

214
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,169
Jesus, was that painful?

215
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,409
Total agony.

216
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,209
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

217
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,729
There's a scar on here.

218
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:05,164
Yeah, can I...?

219
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,129
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

220
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,929
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

221
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,187
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

222
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,009
So, who took it then?

223
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,329
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

224
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,689
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

225
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,289
Really?! Yeah.

226
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,969
Is that for real?

227
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,049
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

228
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,049
So, they saw the lot!

229
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,318
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

230
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:46,300
and then just kind of, liked it.

231
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,529
It's cool.

232
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,609
That's cool.

233
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,769
I mean, because more people are...

234
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,449
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

235
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,889
I believe it's huge with hookers.

236
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,569
I mean, no offence!

237
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,409
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

238
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,627
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

239
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,569
Serial monogamist.

240
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,387
I'm a serial monogamist.

241
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,129
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

242
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:23,249
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

243
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,409
It's a brave choice.

244
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,167
I'm sorry, but I...

245
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,169
I couldn't do it.

246
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,209
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

247
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,049
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

248
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:45,944
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

249
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,565
just not trustworthy.

250
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,329
Colleen works in Grain development.

251
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,406
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

252
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:54,756
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

253
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,280
You can make people
remember getting lost

254
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,169
in shopping malls they
never visited,

255
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,182
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

256
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:06,175
I'm just happier now.

257
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,249
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great...

258
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,968
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

259
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:17,937
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

260
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,369
"Hopes" to look forward.

261
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,009
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

262
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,314
It's phoney.

263
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,974
Hang on.

264
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:29,237
Pause it.

265
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:30,772
Now backup.

266
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,999
Zoom in there.

267
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,289
Come on, that's a tick.

268
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,849
That could be a V or an L.

269
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,245
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

270
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,661
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

271
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,205
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,089
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

273
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,946
No, no, not really.

274
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,880
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

275
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,569
Bit of a dick?

276
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,609
Jonas.

277
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,169
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

278
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,489
It must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

279
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,209
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

280
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,049
"Hey, come on, guys,"

281
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,729
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

282
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,569
Then why invite him over?

283
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,876
I like him.

284
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,249
You wanted me to invite him.

285
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,929
I didn't say anything.

286
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,489
You were laughing
at everything he said.

287
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,009
You invited him!

288
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,348
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

289
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,769
'It's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

290
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:46,485
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

291
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:47,809
'We've got to get back,

292
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,369
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

293
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,248
'Yeah.'

294
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,009
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

295
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,049
See?

296
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,306
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

297
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,277
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

298
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,359
Hey, hey!

299
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,432
Hey.

300
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,262
Well, actually, what time is it?

301
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,780
It's midnight.

302
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,876
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

303
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:30,893
Yeah, time does that.

304
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,129
15 minutes.

305
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,289
Yeah.

306
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,317
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

307
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,289
So, is that new info?

308
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,289
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

309
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,369
Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,729
OK, no, I get it.

311
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,849
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

312
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,889
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

313
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,929
Sorry.

314
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,769
No, it's fine, really.

315
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,809
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,369
It's cool, no worries.

317
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,249
I've got a back-up plan, so...

318
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,009
Cool, well, we vote the back-up.

319
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,449
Yeah, I will do.

320
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,209
See you later, Fi.

321
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,369
It was good to meet you, man.

322
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,381
Yeah.

323
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,849
Nice one.

324
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,270
Brilliant. Brilliant.

325
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,759
OK, cool.

326
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:16,922
Good to meet you, man.

327
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,059
Yeah.

328
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:24,129
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

329
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,423
I have the bed made up in my office.

330
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,865
OK, thanks, Fi.

331
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:33,529
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

332
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,537
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

333
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,569
All right, night.

334
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,609
Night, guys.

335
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,923
Night, Gina.

336
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,544
Thank you.

337
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,135
'Bye-bye.

338
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,049
'OK.

339
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,317
'Love you, love you.'

340
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:15,489
Was he a big part of the gang?

341
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,878
Who? Jonas?

342
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,774
I don't know, yeah?

343
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,889
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

344
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,969
offering backrubs.

345
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,249
Not really.

346
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,997
Circling for an orifice.

347
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,689
Was he always that oily or...

348
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,996
OK, look.

349
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,369
What?

350
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,679
It's nothing, but...

351
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,449
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

352
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,689
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

353
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,849
You had a thing with oily dude man?

354
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,929
It was just a little thing

355
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,449
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

356
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,106
You slept with oily dude man?

357
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:59,249
That's hilarious!

358
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,929
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

359
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,529
What, I told you about Gemma.

360
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,873
Gemma was a nutcase...

361
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,911
But you never mentioned Jonas.

362
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,805
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

363
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,002
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

364
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,249
It was a stupid thing...

365
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:17,289
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

366
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,329
Not him.

367
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,489
It was years ago and...

368
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,889
Are you embarrassed by that?

369
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,866
Cos it's embarrassing.

370
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:28,659
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

371
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,139
It was years ago.

372
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,899
But you dated him for a month?

373
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,099
That's what I said.

374
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,099
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

375
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,957
No, I didn't.

376
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,092
Pah!

377
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,939
'What about you?'

378
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,219
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

379
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,299
Syou're about to talk.

380
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,459
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

381
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,579
'with this, sort of...

382
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,139
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

383
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,459
'Mr Marrakech?'

384
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,779
'Yeah.'

385
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,179
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

386
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,179
'No, it was like dormouse.'

387
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,099
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

388
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,539
'No, it was just a week.

389
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,859
'It was a weird week.'

390
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,179
So, a weird week or a month?

391
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,019
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

392
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,779
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

393
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:26,013
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

394
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,259
That was a nice night, used to be.

395
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,756
You're getting obsessed.

396
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,699
I'm not.

397
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,179
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

398
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,979
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

399
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,979
What? Acting like
he was interested?

400
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,139
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

401
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,219
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

402
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,157
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

403
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,859
And Jonas...

404
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,859
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

405
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,499
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

406
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,739
No, I mean, just...

407
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,739
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

408
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,825
I didn't mean that.

409
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,579
'You're a bitch!'

410
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,739
I'd like you to erase that.

411
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,819
'You're a bitch!'

412
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,699
Also, "sometimes".

413
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,874
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

414
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,483
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

415
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,299
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

416
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,619
'..in a toolshed that just fit
together really fucking well,

417
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,939
'but still by the end I'd be like,
"Go, on, you go to bed, honey,

'"I'm just going to catch a little
bit more of the news,"

419
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,979
'and then I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of hot times

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,052

421

429
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,637
- Morning.
- Gina, over here.

430
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,719
Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

431
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,340
It's just a silly game.

432
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,519
Sit down.

433
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,249
Answer this.

434
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,719
I'm a serial monogamist.

435
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,279
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

436
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,102
Now, is that funny?

437
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:59,330
There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

438
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,999
Is that funny, in your opinion?

439
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:05,795
Well...

440
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,527
I'm a serial monogamist.

441
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,879
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

442
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,187
- No?
- No

443
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,999
- I don't know.
- You do.

444
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,031
Morning.

445
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:19,443
What's this?

446
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:21,849
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

447
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:23,546
I'm a serial monogamist.

448
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:26,639
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

449
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:31,638
I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

450
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,080
and Gina agrees.

451
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:34,660
I don't really want to get involved.

452
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:36,799
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

453
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,279
Just one other thing.

454
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:44,127
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

455
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,397
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

456
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,078
OK, well, bye.

457
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:50,249
Yeah, bye.

458
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:53,606
It's early. It's early
to call it a night.

459
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:55,686
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

460
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:58,802
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

461
00:25:58,803 --> 00:25:59,999
That's just a...

462
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,084
That's a joke.

463
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,452
Sorry.

464
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,393
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

465
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,646
Yeah.

466
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,623
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

467
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,076
I don't know.

468
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:17,334
You do know, Gina.

469
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:19,489
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

470
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,883
That's OK.

471
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:37,025
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

472
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,958
That is just objectively not funny.

473
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,957
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

474
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:44,709
That was fucking embarrassing.

475
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,399
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

476
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,908
Sit down, please.

477
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,919
You see that?

478
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:05,472
You know Geoff?

479
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:08,439
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

480
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:12,439
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

481
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,158
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

482
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:18,239
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

483
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,599
and then I arrived and... you clam.

484
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,655
For clarity.

485
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,719
We're just talking!

486
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,197
But moments later, you're so stiff.

487
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:31,847
I don't know, a re-do...

488
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:33,988
You don't know how
to stand around him.

489
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,439
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

490
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,879
This is just stupid!

491
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,964
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

492
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:42,569
See how you look at him.

493
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,839
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

494
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,119
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

495
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,919
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

496
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,639
Now, how you look at me.

497
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,159
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

498
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,519
It's a brave choice.

499
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,039
I'm sorry, but...

500
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,119
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

501
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,719
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

502
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,719
How long did you go out
with him for?

503
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,736
Does it matter?

504
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,359
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

505
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,151
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

506
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:25,519
And big ones.

507
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,801
Is that Marrakesh?

508
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,942
Does that look like Marrakesh?

509
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,359
No.

510
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,359
It's not Marrakesh.

511
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,359
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

512
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,157
All right, about six months.

513
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:53,435
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

514
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:55,931
The ever-inflating romance.

515
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,879
You're probably still
going out with him.

516
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,477
Why am I on trial here?

517
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:01,559
What's been going on?

518
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,639
Nothing has been going on.

519
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,074
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

520
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:11,395
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

521
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,688
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

522
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:16,163
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

523
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,038
You lied.

524
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,997
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

525
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,599
Hello?

526
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,783
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

527
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,225
Sort of? He's a massive...

528
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,039
I liked him then.

529
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,712
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

530
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,257
So, just to get this clear.

531
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:40,179
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

532
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:41,135
but you're still pally.

533
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,117
This is sad!

534
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,135
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

535
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:45,977
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

536
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:47,512
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

537
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,781
It was years ago!

538
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:51,156
Not for him.

539
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:55,817
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

540
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,645
early in relationships.

541
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,919
'Easy.'

542
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:02,118
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

543
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:04,797
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

544
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:06,863
Fuck.

545
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,972
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

546
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:14,136
early in relationships.

547
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:15,464
Easy.

548
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,799
And I'm downstairs watching
some redo of some night

549
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,959
I've picked up somebody else and...

550
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,439
Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me

551
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,119
and I'm downstairs watching
some redo

552
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,279
of some night I've picked
up somebody else.

553
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,879
Easy.

554
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,797
And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.

555
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,627
'Green warning.

556

560
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:55,785
Thank you.

561
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,194
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

562
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,550
Liam from last night.

563
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:20,357
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

564
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:22,078
She's not, no.

565
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,610
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

566
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,034
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

567
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:29,240
Can you open the gate?

568
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:32,734
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll let you in.

569
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,537
Nice one, nice one.

570
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

571
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,879
What do you want?

572
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,213
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

573
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,397
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

574
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,279
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

575
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,557
Fucking hell. Liam.

576
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,666
Jonas, this is a nice place!

577
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:21,342
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

578
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,795
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

579
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,616
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

580
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,717
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

581
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:36,842
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

582
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,744
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

583
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:42,079
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

584
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,957
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

585
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,245
I'm joking, Jonas.

586
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,039
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

587
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,798
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

588
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:04,633
What's going on?

589
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:09,957
Yeah, figures.

590
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,037
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

591
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,814
I think you should go.

592
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,959
I don't blame you.
I would have.

593
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:20,648
Tell you what, let's have a look.

594
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:23,559
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

595
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:25,161
Come on!

596
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:28,532
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

597
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:32,313
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

598
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,577
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

599
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,681
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

600
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:43,710
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

601
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:48,646
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

602
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:51,479
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

603
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,786
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

604
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,216
I want you to leave.

605
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:02,099
Well, that's a pity.

606
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,796
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

607
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:07,115
Don't do that.
Come on now!

608
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:09,613
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

609
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:13,355
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

610
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,167
Hey.

611
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,332
What do you want?

612
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,415
Don't do that.

613
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,874
Come on, Danny!

614
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:08,664
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

615
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:11,901
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

616
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,293
'Tell you what... '

617
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,685
Stop it!

618
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:22,979
I tell you what you're going to do.

619
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,659
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

620
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,699
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

621
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,425
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

622
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:33,402
'Wipe it!

623
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:34,615
'Fuck off.

624
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,739
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

625
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,899
This is a bottle, right?

626
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,121
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

627
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,166
Jesus!

628
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:44,223
OK.

629
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,317
Just do what he says.

630
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,675
Not on your eye, in there.

631
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,219
On there!

632
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,479
He's doing it!

633
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:57,566
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

634
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:02,625
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

635
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,064
I'm doing it.

636
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,901
Stay away from my house!

637
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,859
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

638
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:33,613
'Or I will crack your skull

639
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,018
'I'm doing it.'

640
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:23,060
Liam?

641
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:25,771
Where did you go?

642
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:32,136
What happened?

643
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,539
Liam, what happened?

644
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,309
Did you use a condom or not?

645
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,076
Just say.

646
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,299
Liam, whatever you think...

647
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,632
Am I Jodie's father?

648
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,259
- Liam!
- Am I?

649
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,339
Yes, of course.

650
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:53,219
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

651
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:55,287
That's nice.

652
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,905
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

653
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,243
It's why I bought it for you.

654
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:07,899
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

655
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,200
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

656
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:25,219
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

657
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,579
' Christ, what have you done?

658
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,659
'Select it all... '

659
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,139
We're getting to the good bit.

660
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,202
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

661
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,339
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

662
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,969
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

663
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:57,238
18 months ago in this room.

664
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,675
You know when you suspect something,

665
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:13,877
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

666
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,339
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

667
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,957
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

668
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,739
That's not what it looks like.

669
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,539
This did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

670
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,579
No, it was...

671
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,739
A story about fucking?

672
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,339
It was...

673
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,415
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

674
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,619
For like ten minutes.

675
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,455
For five days, Liam.

676
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,992
No call, no nothing.

677
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:48,939
So you fucked him after four days?

678
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,419
That's heroic.

679
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,259
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

680
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,059
I mean, you must have been gagging.

681
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,581
I was so upset.

682
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,527
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

683
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,765
It shouldn't have happened.

684
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:07,477
I'm sorry.

685
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:12,939
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

686
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,212
I love you.

687
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,459
Did you use a condom?

688
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,619
Yes.

689
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,384
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

690
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,019
He had some.

691
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,779
In his pocket?

692
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,162
In his car.

693
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:33,397
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

694
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:34,823
I made him.

695
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,866
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

696
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:39,632
Show me, then.

697
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:42,900
Show me on there.

698
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,773
I need to see it, Fi.

699
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:54,255
I deleted it.

700
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,859
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

701
00:40:57,984 --> 00:40:59,435
- Did you?
- Yeah.

702
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,704
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

703
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,277
Yeah.

704
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,658
Show me that, then.

705
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,479
Yeah, OK.

706
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,841
I have to find it.

707
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:22,315
No! No deleting it, not now.

708
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,379
No, no.

709
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,857
It's still on there, is it?

710
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,037
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:37,059
You have to show it to me, Fi.

712
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,259
Why?

713
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,655
Cos I want to see it.

714
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:43,890
I love you.

715
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,987
Show it to me.

716
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:48,499
No.

717
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,739
- Show it to me.
- No.

718
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,979
- Show it to me!
- No!

719
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,544
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

720
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,395
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

721
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,085
Fi, I need to see it!

722
00:42:03,055 --> 00:42:04,398
Please.

723
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,619
I need to see it, Fi.

724
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:53,514
'Hurry up.

725
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:54,795
'Sorry!'

726
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:55,106
I love you.

727
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:57,457
I know you do.

728
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,245
Hello, stinky!

729
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:56,883
Hey.

730
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:22,674
Brown or green?

731
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:24,700
Green?

732
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:43,599
