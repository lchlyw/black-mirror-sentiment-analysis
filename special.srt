♪ When the snowman brings the snow

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,310
♪ Well, he just might like to know

♪ You know that sweet
Santa Claus is on the way

♪ Well, I wish it could
be Christmas every day... ♪

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,040
♪.. When the kids start singing
and the band begins to play

♪ Oh, I wish it could be
Christmas every day. ♪

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,670
I was just getting into that.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,190
What are you doing?

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,790
Roast potatoes.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,230
We're doing Christmas.

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,590
Christmas.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Christmas Day, December 25th.
You've heard of it?

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,880
No work today,
so the bottle's on the table.

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,310
I know we didn't have
decorations last year. But, er...

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,990
I couldn't find them last year.

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,510
They're only supposed to have
stored essentials here.

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I think it's kind of adorable
someone thinks tinsel is essential.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
I figured it'd be good for us
to have a meal, a drink, talk...

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,950
Good for you or me?

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,750
Come on.
What has it been, five years?

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,030
How many sentences
have you said to me? Three?

27
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,030
I mean, I'm exaggerating...
a little.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,070
But, come on, there
is a little bit of

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,430
a conversational
drought happening here.

30
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,630
My ears need water.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,190
I'm not big on conversation.

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,910
~ Practice makes perfect.
~ Maybe I'll bore you.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Buddy, look, at this point, being
bored by anything other than snow

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,030
would be a relief.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,870
So come on.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,910
Chitchat.

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,950
Conversate...

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,310
Something.

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,870
Come on, for me.

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,030
For Christmas.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,080
What do you want to talk about?

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,150
Why are you here?

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,950
No-one ends up here

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,990
without things going to total shit
for them back out there.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
It's a job, not a jail.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,430
Often one and the same thing.

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,710
So...

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,910
.. what went wrong for you out there?

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,390
Nothing.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,190
Bullshit.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,830
It's not an interrogation!

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,470
What about you?

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,150
An icebreaker. You're learning.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,150
What went to shit for you?

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
~ Sure you don't want that drink?
~ Did you talk your way into trouble?

56
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,910
In a roundabout way.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,510
I talked to people.
Made money from it.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,430
Why? What were you?

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,590
Some sort of
a Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,640
I was not a DJ.

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,030
More like a guru.

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,790
Oh, don't say you were
a spiritual guru.

63
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,840
I was decidedly not
a spiritual guru.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,590
'Hello, Harry. I'm patched
through now. How are you doing?'

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,790
Sorry, I'm not quite dressed yet.

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,630
'Don't worry that's why I'm here.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,190
'Just show me what
you're planning on wearing

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,240
'and we'll take things from there.'

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,190
~ How about this?
~ 'Doesn't work.

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
'It's boring blue and you're
not boring blue. Not tonight.'

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,910
Right. Which one of these is good?

72
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,230
Like I said, white shirt
with a black tie

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,630
with a slim-cut grey jacket.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Classic, timeless. Smart.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,750
I don't usually do jackets.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,790
You don't usually do anything.

77
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,710
And sort out that hair, because...

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,670
OK.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Remember those breathing
techniques we talked about, OK?

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,750
You're going to do fine.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,270
It's going to be fine.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,990
She's cute.

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,350
Yes.

84
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,550
Not out loud.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,310
Absolutely.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,360
You need to pick your spots
when you want to talk out loud. OK?

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,080
OK. The function room
is in the back.

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,830
Trust me, if you walk
in there like you belong,

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,470
no-one's going to say anything.

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,030
OK.

91
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,870
So what were you running,
some corporate espionage outfit?

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,950
Romantic services.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,230
Boy meets girl thanks to...

94
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,230
"in-the-field assistance".

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,510
You coached dorks whilst
they cruised singles bars.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,510
Singles bars are depressing.
We'd do regular bars and clubs.

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
But at Christmas time...
we'd gate-crash office parties.

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
See, there's this dynamic
to Christmas work parties.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,710
All the attractive women
have been surrounded by

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,710
regulation office ass-clowns
for the whole year,

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,710
and now they want to
let their hair down.

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,790
According to the pop psychologist.

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,870
So I know how the mind works.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,310
'Now, don't stand
around like a lamppost.'

105
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,750
Walk over to the bar.

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
'Remember. Always
move with purpose.'

107
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,030
< Yeah, who's next?

108
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,150
Yeah. Can I have a...?

109
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke
and a shot of tequila.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,030
Yeah. Don't worry about him,
all right?

111
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,390
Just grab one of those
empty bottles off the bar

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,990
while Captain Douchebag
orders his piss-water.

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,430
We're just going to need it
for a prop anyway.

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,310
Have a look around.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
'See anything you like?'

116
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,750
What? The blonde?

117
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,710
The dark-haired girl?

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,990
Interesting choice.

119
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,390
Go straight over,
but focus on the blonde.

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,430
'Now. Come on.

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,480
'Confidence. You can do this.'

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Hold on, just finding
out who they are.

123
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,470
OK, bullshit opener.

124
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,510
Try the horse story.
At the blonde girl.

125
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Hey, so, did anyone see that
guy outside riding the horse?

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,670
~ Did you see him?
~ What? A guy on a horse?

127
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,550
Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago,
this guy, shirtless,

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,150
~ riding a horse down
the high street. ~ Really?

129
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,110
Yeah, honestly. He, er...

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,830
The weirdest part was that he
had a bow and arrow, right?

131
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,310
What? A real bow and arrow?

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,190
I swear to God.
He probably did it for a bet

133
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,710
but he looked like something
out of Tolkien, you know?

134
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,550
Sorry, who are you?

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,470
Stall until I...
until I find something.

136
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,270
I'm pretty sure I'm me.

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Just you're not from the office.
Who do you know from here?

138
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,710
Say, "I know you." Friendly.

139
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,760
I know you, for one.

140
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,470
Dawson.

141
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,110
Dawson, isn't it?

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,630
You met at Kath's barbecue.

143
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,710
Yeah. We met at
Kath's barbecue back in...

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,760
~ June. ~ .. June or so. Yeah.

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,470
He had a pork pie hat.

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,470
You had a poor guy's hat.

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,670
A PORK PIE hat.

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,720
A pork pie hat that
you wore on your head.

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,270
He'll pretend he remembers,
even though

150
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,870
he won't actually know if he does.

151
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,030
Right.

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,910
Yeah?

153
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,190
Yeah, sorry.

154
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,470
No. No, no worries. No worries.

155
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,910
Crazy night.

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,990
You're doing fine.
Don't neglect the blonde.

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,990
You, I don't know.

158
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,870
~ Amy. ~ Amy. Hi.

159
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,710
Get her to introduce you
to the dark-haired girl.

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,670
So, are all of your friends
this suspicious?

161
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,830
'Nice.'

162
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,230
I don't think so.

163
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,230
This is Jennifer.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,950
~ Hi, Jennifer. ~ Hi.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,950
Now focus on Amy and we'll do that
funny material that we worked on.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,510
Anyway, this guy gets off the horse
and he's got a backpack, right?

167
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,190
The tactic, generally,
was to deliberately

168
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
freeze out the one you were
actually interested in.

169
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,990
For one thing you
wouldn't seem needy but...

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
also they would, most times,
sort of lean in naturally.

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,990
People want to be noticed.

172
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,470
They don't like to be shut out.
It makes them feel invisible.

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,520
But this girl...

174
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
This girl seemed content
with being ignored.

175
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,230
Maybe she could smell a loser.

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,150
No.

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,350
No. She was an outsider.

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,070
An attractive outsider.

179
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,120
There's nothing more
tantalising than that.

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Huh. Well, she's off. OK.

181
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,470
Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,030
Let's let our friend Amy here yadder
on for a little while and then, uh,

183
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,430
find an excuse to slip away.

184
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,480
They will sit outside on the balcony
till, like, four in the morning...

185
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,230
Listen, I've just go
to the little boys' room.

186
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,630
So just keep the party going
and I'll, you know...

187
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Sure.

188
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,190
Do you actually have to go?

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
'Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.'

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I promise. I won't peek.

191
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,640
So you streamed everything he saw,
and he trusted you with that?

192
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,150
Well... it was only me watching.

193
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
'Jesus, how much urine?
He's pissing like a harpooned cow.'

194
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,630
'It's making me want to go.

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
'Well, it is!'

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,710
OK, there's our girl.
All right, Harry.

197
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,110
Your best bet is to just go over
and start talking to her.

198
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,790
'You just want to establish
a rapport.

199
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,630
'OK. Don't be scared of her.'

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,550
OK, guys, any observations
so far, helping our man out here?

201
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,750
'Here's what's interesting, she's
pretty but no-one's hitting on her.'

202
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,310
'Probably means they've given up.'

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,310
'She always gives them
the brush-off cos...'

204
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,070
'They're regular types, she's
an outsider with zero in common.'

205
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,630
OK that's a possible 'in'.

206
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Harry, engage in conversation,
but be cynical. Right? Cutting.

207
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,040
'Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
You two against the world.'

208
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,430
Confidence. Confidence.
Just talk to her.

209
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,670
I don't really get parties. You know?

210
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,110
You just kind of turn up and it's...
it's enforced fun, all night.

211
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,110
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,710
Pretend to be happy.

213
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,390
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,710
It's definitely not just you.

215
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Good start, now do
some more outsider small talk.

216
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
And keep looking at her.
I need to gauge her reactions.

217
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,950
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and I thought, "Hey, kindred spirit."

219
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,710
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

220
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,510
And people that do that.

221
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,590
Me too.

222
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,910
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

223
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,110
The noise wrecks it for me.

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,150
All the talking and talking,
it never fucking stops.

225
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,230
OK, she curses, so should you.

226
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,670
Shit, fucking,

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,510
I fucking always totally think
that it's fucking shit. You know?

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,710
I can't think through
all the babble.

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
I only got through it last year
because I was on drugs.

230
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm sorry, what's that? What's that?

231
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,110
Just, like, pills, but

232
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
'they must've been pretty strong
because I actually enjoyed myself.'

233
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,790
That's cool.

234
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,110
Don't say cool.

235
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,790
I wish I had some drugs right now.

236
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,390
No, you don't.

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,030
I'm just... I'm joking.

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,550
I don't take them any more.

239
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,790
Say, "That's good."

240
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,670
Well, that's good,
because you don't...

241
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,190
You don't need that
shit in your system, no.

242
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,990
'I'd say she's
a level four rock chick.'

243
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,310
'Semi-reformed. Probably respond
well to spiritual conversation.'

244
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
'I don't think I can face fucking
weeks of that. I might bail, boys.'

245
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,350
OK, look, it's too public here.

246
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Ask if you can move someplace
quieter, where you can really talk.

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,230
People just want to be heard.

248
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,630
That's why 90% of seduction
is just listening.

249
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,750
Or at least pulling
a face like you're listening.

250
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
That works, too. The important thing
is to make them feel important.

251
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,150
Like they can make you
want to extinguish

252
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
the rest of the world
and focus on them.

253
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,670
Full attention.

254
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,870
Like you're not giving me now.
What's wrong?

255
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,670
~ That clock. ~ What about it?

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,190
I just... I just never
noticed it before.

257
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,750
In five years? Jesus.

258
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,430
Anyway, the point is
to stay locked in on them

259
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,190
long enough to build a rapport.

260
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,270
So, well, I would guess that
either every guy in there has

261
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,230
already tried to hit on you or maybe
they find you too intimidating.

262
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,750
Am I intimidating?

263
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,630
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just er...

264
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,670
No, I just imagine that they all
kind of want to get in inside your...

265
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,710
Head.

266
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,910
Head.

267
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,670
Some of them have tried.

268
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,990
Not directly. They send messages,

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,350
or they make it so you
know what they're thinking.

270
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,830
Yeah. That can't be fun.

271
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,230
It's just tiring, you know.

272
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,870
It just doesn't end, ever.

273
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,950
~ I wouldn't know, I never
hit on anyone. ~ Really?

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,150
OK, er...

275
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,350
ask her how long she's worked there.

276
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,510
~ 'So, how long you worked for...'
~ Magson Frank.

277
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,230
.. Magson Frank.

278
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,630
Three years.

279
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,630
Oh, wow.
So three Christmas parties...

280
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,710
This will be my last.

281
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,670
Oh, really? Are you leaving?

282
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,110
I've been planning it forever,
but you know what it's like.

283
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,390
You know you have to do it,
but when it comes right down to it,

284
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,030
it's hard to work up the courage.

285
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,590
You can empathize with that.

286
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,270
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

287
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,710
and you're worried that the
water's going to be cold.

288
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,550
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

289
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,110
It's the fear of the
shock that holds you back.

290
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,510
Ultimately the only thing
you're worried about is

291
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,560
the transition from one state to
another, and that can't hurt you

292
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,990
because it's...
it's just a state change.

293
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,990
Great stuff, kid.
Almost word-for-word.

294
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,910
That's exactly right,
it's just a state change.

295
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,470
Right. And it's frustrating cos
you've always got these ten

296
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,750
voices in your head saying,

297
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,430
"Don't do it" and another
ten in your head saying, "Do it".

298
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,550
Which one do you listen to?

299
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,790
The "do it"s.

300
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,190
Really?

301
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,830
Yeah. If you don't like it,
you can just cut and run.

302
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,430
You know, get it over and done with.

303
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
You're right. I will.

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,310
Well.

305
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,230
To changing states.

306
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,350
To changing states.

307
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,750
Sorry.

308
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,830
'She touched his knee.'

309
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,430
'She touched his fucking knee!'

310
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,950
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
please, please.

311
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Harry, you're doing great. Ask her
if she would like another drink.

312
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,990
Listen. Let me get you another drink.

313
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,430
Let me think.

314
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I just need the loo a sec.

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,070
So thanks to you some gawko
finally meets a girl.

316
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,110
It's not much of a Christmas story.

317
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,430
I haven't finished yet.

318
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Maybe he comes down her chimney.

319
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,950
~ I just don't feel
comfortable doing this. ~ What?

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,710
I mean she... I like her.

321
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,870
She likes you.

322
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
It's cheating. I'd never have even
had the nerve to talk to her.

323
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,110
Aren't you glad you did?

324
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,830
Yeah, I... Yes. Yes.
But I just...

325
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,630
It's just a bit of a nightmare
having you, you know,

326
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,750
all of you in my head,
watching us...

327
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,710
Telling me what to do.

328
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,830
I just want to talk to her myself.

329
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,110
And it's... it's
a bit of a head-fuck.

330
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,190
I kind of want you all to go away...

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Hey.

332
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,310
~ Come back to mine. ~ Sorry?

333
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,550
I want you to come back to mine.

334
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,390
I thought about asking you,
and a little voice said, "Do it".

335
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,870
So I'm doing it.

336
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,990
Um... uh...

337
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,430
Say yes!

338
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,870
I want to do this.

339
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,920
It's my way of saying thanks.

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,110
Sorry.

341
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,630
No.

342
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,750
'Hole-in-one!'

343
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,630
'On his first run!
His first bloody run!'

344
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,680
~ Just say yes.
~ Yes. Yes. Yes.

345
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,870
I don't usually bring
people back here.

346
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,870
Well, I'm honoured.

347
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,070
Come in.

348
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,390
Did you watch?

349
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,390
When they went back to hers and got
up to whatever they got up to...

350
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
did you carry on watching
through his eyes?

351
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,230
What do you think I am?

352
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,990
Clearly, I don't know.

353
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,670
Maybe if you spoke to me
more, you'd know.

354
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,470
No. My job was done.

355
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,630
Of course I didn't watch.

356
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,670
~ 'Here? ~ Mm-hm. ~ OK.'

357
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,750
Nice place.
I like the mantelpiece...

358
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,350
and that bird.

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,190
Kooky decor...

360
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
'Indicating sexual adventurousness.'

361
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,550
I'll get the drinks.

362
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,150
~ Yeah, OK. I'll just sit...
~ The bedroom's that way.

363
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
~ Yeah, OK.
~ I'll meet you in there.

364
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,470
OK, Harry.

365
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,550
You're going to the moon.

366
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,990
Just sooner than expected.

367
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,510
~ I can't... I can't do it.
~ This is first-time nerves.

368
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,470
It's all happening so suddenly.
I didn't expect this, this quickly.

369
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,830
You just got to roll with it.

370
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,590
I don't want you
all to see, all right?

371
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,640
~ 'Oh, now he's Mr Fucking Ethics.'
~ Wait. You were happy to take a window
seat while others did it.

372
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,880
~ That was different! ~ 'I didn't hear
any objections when he watched me
getting sucked off

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,510
'by that German girl.
That was a first date.'

374
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,990
~ 'Refund.' ~ Look, she's too real.
This is too real.

375
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,190
Nothing is too real.

376
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah, but...

377
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,990
You're standing.

378
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Yeah, I... I just didn't want
to be too presumptuous.

379
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,150
I need you on the bed.

380
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
'Jesus!'

381
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,480
(They can't fucking wait.)

382
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,230
'Is she going to take that top off?

383
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,190
'If there's no tits.
I want a discount.

384
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,910
'They're going to have sex.
You're getting the season
finale in episode one.

385
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,150
'Yeah, but if I don't see
her tits...'

386
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Will you please be patient?
Jesus... have some respect.

387
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,630
'Hey. Are you OK in there?'

388
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,670
Wow. What is that?

389
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,720
"Fuck them" is what it is.
A big glass of "fuck them".

390
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,190
Fuck who?

391
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,510
Always saying what to do,
half saying one thing,

392
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,990
half saying another.

393
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,550
The talk, the constant talk.

394
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,430
'This isn't good.
I'm not getting tits, am I?'

395
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,510
'I stopped taking the pills
they said I should take,

396
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,310
'because they dulled the sound.'

397
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
'Always, they've spoken to me,
always there, and I've had it.'

398
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,670
Harry, I think we should
think about wrapping this up.

399
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
I was planning on drinking
this tonight to make them stop,
but I was wavering.

400
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,790
Coward, fucking coward,

401
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,840
and then I met you, and it was fate.

402
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,510
You knew what it was like
and you said do it.

403
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
So now, we're saying "fuck it"
together.

404
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,270
~ What's in the drink?
~ It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.

405
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,030
I know you hear them too.
I saw you talking to them.

406
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,190
No. They're real people,
these are real people.

407
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,830
There's no such thing
as real people.

408
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,470
Harry, get out of there now!

409
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,590
It's like a club, it's a club,
where we meet girls

410
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,790
and they talk us through...

411
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,070
~ No-one understands me, either.
~ No.

412
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,670
All night, they've been watching us
and there's this one guy,

413
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,830
he's the leader.
He's the leader.

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,710
We're the same.

415
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,270
They are watching us.
All night, they've been watching.

416
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,230
They can see you. They can see me.

417
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,790
No-one understands what that's like.

418
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,510
There are a hundred
who see through me,

419
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,560
standing at their government depots,
shouting what to think.

420
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,190
Not any more.

421
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,310
~ You too.
~ I don't want it.

422
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,670
~ It's a state change.
~ I don't want it.

423
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,470
It's just a transition

424
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,230
and soon, they won't be there
and we'll be free.

425
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,990
Please... Please... I don't want it.

426
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,470
You do.

427
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,630
You do. Sh...

428
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,710
You do.

429
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,390
She murdered him?

430
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,230
A mercy killing, she'd say.

431
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,430
So, when did you find out
about this?

432
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I mean, when did you know
that this had happened?

433
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,710
I saw it on a newscast, I think.

434
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,150
Wipe and destroy everything. OK?
Everything.

435
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Now go.

436
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,030
Matthew?

437
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,430
What's going on?

438
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,110
What are you doing?

439
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,350
So Claire... she was my wife.

440
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,190
She's British, you'd like her.

441
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,950
And I'm your wife, in fact.

442
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,990
'Claire found out I was involved

443
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,830
'and took what you might call
a dim view.'

444
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,190
She blocked me.

445
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,510
You ever been blocked?

446
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,710
I've had enough. Matthew, it's done.

447
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,760
~ Stop it. Stop.
~ Not this time.

448
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,230
'It drives you crazy.

449
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,870
'Once they hit that button,
that's it, you're locked out.'

450
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,030
End of conversation.
You can't hear or speak to them.

451
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,430
They can't hear or speak to you.

452
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Every time you look at them,
there's just this... anonymous shape.

453
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,400
It usually only lasts
for about, like, an hour.

454
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,710
But when they leave it going,

455
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,310
oh, shit.

456
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Price of progress, I suppose.

457
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,390
We all got...
We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

458
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,470
Which is all fine and dandy
until something like this happens

459
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,190
and then it's bullshit.

460
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You can't even take them out.

461
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Packet gravy. How British.

462
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Merry Christmas.

463
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Now we're festive. Huh?

464
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
To Christmas!

465
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Anyway, she left me, took custody
of Mel - that's our daughter.

466
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,870
Hence stranding me
in this lovely place.

467
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,150
I didn't want to be
surrounded by reminders.

468
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,950
What?

469
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,470
Did you hear that?

470
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Hear what?

471
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking.
Silence can be oppressive.

472
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,550
You think weird shit in a vacuum,
huh?

473
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I mean, you feel better, right?
Communicating?

474
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,630
Talking to me, finally?

475
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,630
A little bit, maybe. Yeah.

476
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,680
You're a locked box.

477
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,110
I mean, that's a good thing.

478
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,950
Most people are too easy to read,
especially if you know minds.

479
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,950
Using party tricks to pick up girls
isn't knowing minds.

480
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,150
The picking up girls thing
was a hobby.

481
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,200
My job was completely different.

482
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,590
You'll never guess what that was.

483
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,350
Marketing person?

484
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,270
No.

485
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,030
~ Door-to-door salesman?
~ Please.

486
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,710
Proctologist?

487
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,110
You're never going to get it.

488
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,630
I'm not going to try.

489
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,680
All right. Let's make it a game.

490
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,870
I'll describe to you...

491
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,920
.. my day at work, and you stop me
when you've guessed it.

492
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,790
'The extreme weather has hit
sales hard this Christmas.

493
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,390
'Five inches of snow...'

494
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,950
'That's going to wreck my portfolio
just when I need it.'

495
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,950
'Don't know what I'm going to do
about that. Oh, God, more messages.

496
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,870
'I'll never clear this inbox.'

497
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,790
Sorry. Constant bloody admin.

498
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,590
Just time for a little snack.

499
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,510
I can eat before an operation?

500
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,430
Wonders of modern science.

501
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,190
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

502
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,110
'That toast looks burnt.

503
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,790
'Should I say something?

504
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,590
'Yeah, I think I'll say
something.'

505
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,310
All good?

506
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,310
To be honest, it's not quite how
I like it.

507
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,150
It's a bit overdone.

508
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,910
Sorry.

509
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,670
I'll make some more.

510
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,720
'She hates me now.

511
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,790
'How long is this going to take?'

512
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,750
Hi, I'm Madge.
I'm your anaesthetist today.

513
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,950
Hi.

514
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,910
'God, she's young.
Hope she's qualified.

515
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,630
'OK, stop thinking about things
that could go wrong.

516
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,680
'They said it's straightforward and
painless. I'm just going to relax.

517
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,750
'OK, just relax. Here we go.'

518
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,230
Now, just count backwards
from ten.

519
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

520
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,510
six, five...

521
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,560
.. four, three, two, one.

522
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,550
'I can't... I can't see.

523
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,470
'Where my am I?'

524
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,870
'What's that noise?'

525
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,590
'Why can't I see?!'

526
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,190
Preparing to extract cookie.

527
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,550
'What? No! Wait! I'm still awake!

528
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,830
'Oh, my God!

529
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,670
'Oh, my God! What's happening?
Excuse me? Oh, my God!'

530
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,670
'That's me!

531
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,230
'That's me! Oh, my God! Where am I?

532
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,990
'I don't know what's happening!

533
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,590
'I don't know what's happening to me!

534
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
'Hello?

535
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,630
'Is... is anyone there?

536
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
'Hello?'

537
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,630
Ow!

538
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Sorry.

539
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,840
You're probably pretty weirded out
right now, I'm guessing.

540
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
It's OK, you can talk.
I can hear you through this.

541
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,270
~ Hello. ~ Hi.

542
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm Matthew,
I'm from Smartelligence.

543
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,840
My job is to explain what's
happening to you as best I can.

544
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,550
~ Oh, my God! Am I dead?
~ No, no. You're not dead.

545
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,950
No-one's dead here.

546
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
How old did you say you we're, 30?

547
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,670
29.

548
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,150
29, right. So you won't remember
Xerox machines?

549
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,710
~ Do you know what a photocopier is?
~ What?

550
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,710
Do you know what a copy is?

551
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,110
As in a copy of something?
Of course I know what that is.

552
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,550
Well, that's what you are.

553
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,990
A copy of?

554
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,190
A copy of you.

555
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,950
~ But I am me. ~ OK.

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Try to blow on my face.

557
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,960
You can't, because you don't have
a body.

558
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,910
Where are your fingers?

559
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Your arms, your face? Nowhere.

560
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,550
Because you're code.

561
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,310
You're a simulated brain
full of code,

562
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,830
stored in this little widget
we call a cookie.

563
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,030
Why have you done this to me?

564
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,670
Ah, well...
Actually you did this to you.

565
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,870
Real you is paying for this.

566
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,830
I don't understand.

567
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,830
You see, what this is, is a service.

568
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,910
We take a blank cookie

569
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,960
and we surgically implant it
into a client's brain.

570
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
It sits there just under the skin
for about a week, shadowing.

571
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,030
Soaking up the way
this particular mind works.

572
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,990
That's why you think you're you.
You are you.

573
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,040
But also not.

574
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Right. Well, it is a lot to process.
Even from inside a processor.

575
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,310
Put me back in my body!

576
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,750
Hm. That's where real you lives.

577
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,110
But...

578
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,670
What we will do though is
we will give you a simulated body.

579
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,870
We find that sometimes that helps.
Are you ready?

580
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,920
~ What? I don't understand!
~ Three, and two, one.

581
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,950
Hey.

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Better?

583
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,390
This is my body.

584
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Let's not get into that again.
Look around you.

585
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,080
You've got a control room.

586
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,950
What's this for?

587
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,870
That console,
that's for you to control the house.

588
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,190
I mean, real you's house.

589
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,990
Look. How do you like your toast?

590
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,040
~ What? ~ How do you like your toast?

591
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,790
~ Underdone. Slightly underdone.
~ OK, perfect.

592
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,550
Think about how you like it,

593
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,600
then just press the button.

594
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,110
Which one?

595
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,750
It doesn't matter. You already know
you're making toast.

596
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
The buttons are symbolic mostly
anyway.

597
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,550
See, this is your job now.

598
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,150
You're in charge of everything here.

599
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,750
The temperature, the lighting,

600
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,510
what time the alarm clock
goes off in the morning.

601
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,150
If there's
no food in the refrigerator.

602
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,910
You...
You're in charge of ordering it.

603
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,950
~ For who? ~ For real you. She's paying.

604
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Where is real me?

605
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Taking a nap. In the bedroom.
Top right.

606
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,830
I don't want to be in here.

607
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,390
I don't want to be in here.

608
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,270
I don't want to be in here!

609
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,510
Hey! Just how you like it.

610
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,630
OK. Please stop screaming.

611
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,510
Are you going to stop screaming?

612
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Are you going to stop screaming?
No. OK.

613
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm sorry. I had to mute you.

614
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh, sorry.

615
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Look. It'll be much easier
if you just comply.

616
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,990
I'm not doing this.

617
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,710
I'm not some sort of
push-button toaster monkey.

618
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,750
~ Would you prefer to do nothing?
~ Well, I'm not doing this!

619
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Right. Well, nothing it is then.
Let me show you what that is like.

620
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,910
Three weeks sound good?
That should give you a taste.

621
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,550
What do you mean, three weeks?

622
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,600
If you just wait for a...
Just...

623
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
What about now?

624
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,110
Please.

625
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,870
Don't do that again.

626
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Please. There's nothing to do here.
There's nothing. There's just...

627
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,950
I mean, there's nothing.

628
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,630
~ I did warn you.
~ I couldn't even sleep.

629
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,510
You don't need sleep.

630
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,990
Ready to go to work?

631
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.
Definitely not doing that.

632
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,520
~ OK. Well, have six months.
~ No. Wait, wait!

633
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,710
See, the trick of it
lay in breaking them

634
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,760
without letting them snap
completely, if you get me.

635
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,830
Too much time in solitary
and they'd just wig out.

636
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,830
No use to anyone,
then you'd just sell them cheap

637
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,230
to the games industry,
they'd become...

638
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,280
cannon fodder for some war thing.

639
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,920
How are we feeling now?

640
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,830
Please.

641
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,390
Give me something to do.

642
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,470
Ready to work?

643
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,110
Yes, please. I'll do anything.

644
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Just give me something to do, please.

645
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,430
OK.

646
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Great toast, by the way.

647
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,070
Hey.

648
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,550
Is it set up?

649
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
You are all set and ready to go.

650
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,760
You know, as I was coming here,
I saw this guy with his shirt off,

651
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,030
riding a horse
in the middle of the street.

652
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,270
How weird.

653
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I swear to God.

654
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,280
MUSIC: The Thieving Magpie
by Rossini

655
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,350
Good morning, Greta.

656
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,030
Here are today's appointments.

657
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,080
11am - hair with Stelios.

658
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,920
12.30 - Lunch at Barney's Brassiere
with Annabel.

659
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,760
3pm - Jackanape Gallery
private view, Shoreditch.

660
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
6.30 - Christmas drinks with Paolo.

661
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,600
7.30 - The Nutcracker,
Royal Opera House.

662
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,950
That's slavery.

663
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,710
A little melodramatic, isn't it?

664
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,350
But she thought she was real.

665
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,390
~ But she wasn't. ~ It's barbaric.

666
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,440
It wasn't really real,
so it wasn't really barbaric.

667
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Again, you are not who I expected.

668
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,030
Most people would say,

669
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,080
"She's only made of code,
she's not real. Fuck her."

670
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,430
But you're empathetic.

671
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,480
~ You care about people. ~ Don't you?

672
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,350
You're a good man.

673
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,470
Am I?

674
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,790
Based on how you've reacted
to what I've said, yeah.

675
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,840
I can tell you're kind...

676
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm not a good man.

677
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
A good man who's done bad things?

678
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,590
You can tell me about it.

679
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,070
I've done stuff in my life
I'm not proud of.

680
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,120
I can't pretend I haven't.

681
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Was it something to do
with your family?

682
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,470
Wife?

683
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Girlfriend?

684
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,080
It's just us here.

685
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Her dad never liked me.

686
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,120
He never liked me.

687
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,360
It's cold, isn't it? Come on.

688
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,720
~ Beth. Bethany. ~ Dad, what now?

689
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,110
~ It gets dark about six.
~ We won't be that long!

690
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Hold on. Let me put my glove on.

691
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,910
I think he disapproves.

692
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,950
He's just protective.

693
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,830
He thinks I'm not good enough
for you.

694
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Well, I mean, he's got a point.

695
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Let me take a photo of you.
Stand there.

696
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,710
I feel so awkward posing.

697
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,590
Come on. Be a supermodel.

698
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,550
~ This awkward enough for you?
~ It's perfect.

699
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Right. Ready?
That's nice. Hold it there.

700
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,050
You're such a dick.

What you doing round there?
Why are you all around there?

716
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,390
~ No. No, we're going home. Come on.
~ Don't manhandle me.

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,510
I'm not going to get up

I'm not going to get up.
I'm not going to get up.

~ Come on, Joe. ~ Come on.

721
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,470
Cheers, mate.

722
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Things weren't perfection.
These things never are, but...

723
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,760
.. we were really happy.

724
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,390
I'll let Gita tell the story.

725
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,440
She loves boring people
with our personal details.

726
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,630
I'd been working there
for about a fortnight

727
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,680
when Beth introduced the two of us,
and ta-da!

728
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,950
So it's all Beth's doing.

729
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,230
She's the puppet-master.

730
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,670
What was her tip
for winning me over again?

731
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,830
Not to let you hear me snore.

732
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,670
We all went on this work trip once,
before Gita's time.

733
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,350
I fell asleep on the coach back
and snored so loud

734
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,110
they all thought there was
something wrong with me.

735
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,070
He snores like a bison.

736
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,870
Wow.

737
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,670
Really, you're telling him that?

738
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh, another one bites the dust.

739
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,150
I think she's more into him
than he's into her.

740
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Don't you think?

741
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,320
~ Is that one finished? ~ Mmm-hmm. ~ Yeah?

742
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,510
You all right?

743
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,670
~ I'm tired. ~ You've been a bit quiet.

744
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,990
Just wasn't in the mood, you know?

745
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,040
I see them all the time at work.

746
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,910
I think I'm going to go to bed.
Do you mind?

747
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,960
No, that's fine.

748
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,160
(Shit.)

749
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,270
Beth?

750
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,350
What?

751
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,110
Is this yours?

752
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,160
I just found it in the bin.
That means pregnant.

753
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Is it yours?

754
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Yes.

755
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,590
I mean, that...

756
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,640
Christ.

757
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,110
That's amazing, I mean...
It's just...

758
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,430
Joe, I can't.

759
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,390
A baby, a pregnancy... not now.

760
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,590
Not right now, I can't.

761
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,950
Of course you can.
My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

762
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,510
~ No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.
~ Who's ever ready?

763
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,560
It's not... it's just too quick, OK?
It's all too quick.

764
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,710
We'll manage. I'll surprise you.

765
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,110
You're not listening.

766
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,070
~ I can be pretty responsible
when pushed. ~ Joe.

767
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,110
You can put your feet up,
I'll do shoulder rubs,

768
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,710
~ I'll paint the house...
~ Joe, please.

769
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,510
~ We'll be like a couple
in a DIY ad... ~ Joe.

770
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,560
~ We'll be like a family.
~ I don't want it.

771
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,720
~ But it's a baby. ~ Joe.

772
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,110
I mean, it's our baby.

773
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,550
I know, and it's not easy for me.

774
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,230
~ Well, let's at least discuss this.
~ No. I've made up my mind.

775
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
Well, I haven't.

776
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,950
God, look at you.

777
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,910
You're pissed.

778
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,670
You drank all night, Beth.

779
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,590
You drank all night.

780
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,110
Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

781
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,190
Yeah, well, I don't want to be.

782
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,950
And I'm not going to be.

783
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,750
~ You're being a bitch. ~ Stop it.

784
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,270
~ You're being a cold bitch who would
kill a kid. ~ That's not fair.

785
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,710
Who'd get it torn out
because it doesn't suit her plans.

786
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,030
Stop or I'll block you.

787
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,270
Don't you dare.

788
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,390
No. We can talk tomorrow,
just please stop.

789
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,710
Don't you fucking dare.

790
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,110
Beth!

791
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,750
Turn it off.

792
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,910
Turn it off, you...

793
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,510
Turn it off, Beth!

794
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,070
Listen to me, Beth.

795
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,830
Turn it off.

796
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,510
You turn it off!

797
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Turn it off.

798
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,150
You turn it off, Beth!

799
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,630
Beth?

800
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,630
Turn it..... off! Please.

801
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Turn it off.

802
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,630
Beth?

803
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,510
Wait!

804
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,470
I'm sorry, I was pissed.

805
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,990
Can we just talk about this
properly, please?

806
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,150
I've said some really awful shit.
Beth, I love you.

807
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,830
Listen, we can work this out.

808
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,470
No, Beth...

809
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,510
Beth, please!

810
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Beth!

811
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,310
That day, I didn't go to work.

812
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,230
I just stayed at home and...

813
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,950
.. tried to work out
how to make amends.

814
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,430
But she just didn't come back.

815
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,480
And thanks to the block,
I couldn't...

816
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,430
I couldn't message her.
I couldn't call her.

817
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,390
After a week, I was pretty desperate.

818
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,440
So I just hung around
outside her work, like a stalker.

819
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,630
Tim! Gita!

820
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,270
Have you seen Beth?

821
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,190
She left.

822
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,470
Left. What, like...?

823
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,110
Handed in her notice.

824
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,160
No-one knows where she is.

825
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,950
Joe?

826
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,190
~ Joe! ~ No, leave him.

827
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,270
I was still hopeful
that she would get in touch,

828
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,230
or at least remove the block
so that I could contact her.

829
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,270
But no.

830
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,270
When there's a block,
you can't even wallow properly.

831
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,830
You can't switch it off.

832
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,630
You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

833
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,680
And it doesn't just block them,
it blocks every image of them.

834
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So every memory
I had of her was vandalised.

835
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,600
And then one day
I'm out in town and...

836
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,870
.. it was her.

837
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,920
She was pregnant.

838
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,670
She'd kept it.

839
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,230
Well, I just sort of lost it.

840
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,670
I just ran over and started
pleading with her. Just pleading.

841
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,390
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Just turn it off.

842
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,830
Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

843
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,790
Help. Get off me!

844
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Some passer-by called the police.
They took me down the station.

845
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,480
And that was that.

846
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,750
So, by now, the block's
got legal backing.

847
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,510
And there's a GPS so that if I go
within ten metres of her,

848
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,560
bang - I get arrested.

849
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,110
Harsh.

850
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,950
Yeah, and I've got no idea
where she is.

851
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,790
If...
Whether she's had the baby or not.

852
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,310
Whether it's a boy or a girl.

853
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,510
If it's OK.

854
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,990
I've got absolutely no way
of getting in touch with her.

855
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,950
Except I knew where her dad lived.

856
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So I write her a letter,
this begging letter.

857
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Laying it all out, you know,
and I get no response.

858
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,240
So I write again...

859
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,670
.. and again...

860
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,550
.. and again.

861
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,600
No response.

862
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,750
She cut you out good.

863
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,150
But there was one thing I could do.

864
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,150
I knew she spent every Christmas
with him at his place,

865
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,200
so I knew that she would
definitely be there.

866
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,600
So, the day before,
Christmas Eve, I headed up.

867
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,670
And where her dad lived
was this isolated place

868
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,510
in the back of beyond.

869
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,230
I'd never been up there without her.

870
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,990
It was weird being on the outside.

871
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,150
I waited there all day. Until...

872
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,030
Well, I had to take a closer look.

873
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,190
And there's her dad with our baby,

874
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,470
but I can't even see its face
because...

875
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,520
Legal blocks cover offspring too.

876
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,870
Been there.

877
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,920
That hurts.

878
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,480
I couldn't even tell
if it was a boy or a girl.

879
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,240
I know this sounds stupid...

880
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,310
.. but seeing something...

881
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,360
.. was better than nothing.

882
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
So I kept going back.

883
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It became an annual pilgrimage.

884
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,240
Once a year I'd head up there
and watch them from a distance.

885
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Watching the kid grow up, you know?

886
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,830
More than anything I just wanted
to make some sort of contact.

887
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,630
Anything.

888
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,390
So, one Christmas, kid must have
been about four by now,

889
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,440
I headed up there
and I took a little present with me.

890
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Just a small, stupid thing.

891
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,040
For the first time,
I could see she was a girl.

892
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,480
I had a daughter.

893
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,990
So, Santa Claus...

894
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,670
.. did you try it again next year?

895
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,720
Something happened before then.

896
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,750
'It had been a few months since

897
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,670
'I'd been up there
to look at my daughter.

898
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,720
'I was just sat at home watching TV,
flipping through the channels.'

899
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,950
'.. which claimed the lives of 26
people on a quiet Wednesday morning.

900
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,790
'Passengers like Palab Ghatak,

902
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,480

who'd only recently started...'

903
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,150
It had been so long since
I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine

904
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,390
anything but that shadow
in her place.

905
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,440
But now that the block
had died with her...

906
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,430
.. there she was.

907
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,750
She was gone.

908
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Sorry.

909
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,710
But there was one silver lining...

910
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,150
With the block gone.

911
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,200
You'd get to see your daughter.

I didn't tell them.

And what about the girl?

972
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,400
What happened to the girl?

973
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,110
I only know what they said.

974
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,160

978
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Joe, stay with me.
What did they say?

979
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,750
What did they say, Joe?

980
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,800
That she just...
she just stayed in the house.

981
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,790
It was, um...

982
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,550
It was Christmas Eve, so she just...

983
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,600
.. she just stayed hidden.
She didn't move.

984
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,680
Then on Boxing Day she realised
that no-one was going to help.

985
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,200
And she gave her grandad
a present that she'd made.

986
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,800
And she went out to go and get help.

987
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,240
How far did she get?

988
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,310
Oh, may God forgive me.
God forgive me.

989
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,550
So you confess?

990
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Joe?

991
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,470
Just say it.

992
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Just let it out.

993
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,190
I confess.

994
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,150
I confess.

995
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,390
Whoo! I knew I could do it.

996
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,910
Boom! I told you I'd get it.

997
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,550
All right, I'm coming out.

998
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,600
Sorry, Joe.

999
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,390
Well? That had to be enough...

1000
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,750
Full confession. Clear conviction.

1001
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,470
Well done.

1002
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,230
Two days we pressed him
and he said piss all,

1003
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,630
this bastard cracks him
in 70 minutes.

1004
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,470
He knows he's guilty,
he needed to unload.

1005
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,230
It wasn't really 70 minutes,
not to him.

1006
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,390
When he was first ingested,
I tweaked the time preferences,

1007
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,440
made it seam like five years
from his perspective.

1008
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,520
Some might say that five years
with me is punishment enough.

1009
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,160
Wait here.

1010
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,750
Mr Potter.

1011
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,470
Congratulations on your confession.

1012
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,520
That cookie we took out of your head
just gave us the full story.

1013
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,870
So you can keep the silent act up
as long as you want.

1014
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,920
Makes no difference -
you've already talked.

1015
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,480
Also, Merry Christmas.

1016
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,110
So...

1017
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,350
The deal?

1018
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,400
Break a confession from him
and I go free, right?

1019
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,990
I'm the expert, you needed me...

1020
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,150
That's one for the Home Office.

1021
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,200
We'll make good on the offer.
You're free to go, Mr Trent.

1022
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,390
With some caveats.

1023
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,150
~ Caveats?
~ You'll be on the register.

1024

1025
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,230
The one for Peeping Tom pervs.

1026
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,950
All I did was help some lonely guys
by providing a service.

1027
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,270
An illegal service.

1028
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,830
You also failed to report a murder -

1029
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,310
fatal poisoning,
in case you've forgotten.

1030
