1
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,820
Hello.

2
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,020
Just tell me what's happened.

3
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
And what is it?

4
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,540
I'll be right down.

5
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,740
What's happened?

6
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,019
Susannah.

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,219
Susannah?

8
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,459
Princess Susannah.

9
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,460
Is she all right?

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,780
Don't know.

11
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,180
'Don't kill me.

12
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,259
'Please don't kill me.'

13
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,659
'Read the statement.

14
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,020
'Yes. All right.

What are you doing? Keep it going.

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,339
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

30
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,419
that we are 100% certain

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,659
that this is, indeed,

32
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,620
Princess Susannah.

33
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:26,499
Her car was intercepted shortly after midnight,
returning from the wedding of a college friend.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,699
She'd insisted on going.

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,820
But you had security on her?

36
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,259
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

37
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,219
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,299
No sign of struggle.

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,460
What do they want? Money?

40
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
Release the Jihadi?

41
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,220
Scrap Third World debt?

42
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,899
Save the fucking libraries?

43
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,499
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

44
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,420
What demand?

45
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:00,260
What Susannah says next...

46
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,860
It concerns you directly, sir.

47
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,740
Just play it.

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,099
'There is only one demand,
and it is a simple one.

'I don't understand!'

56
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,900
The video ends with a series of technical
specifications for the broadcast.

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,100
Why are you doing this?

58
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,779
"Mike!"

59
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,460
It's real.

60
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,139
She said pig.

61
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,100
Sex with a pig.

62
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,939
They want me to have sex with a pig?

63

this afternoon.

65
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,179
But what...? Who...?

66
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,299
We're checking with embedded operatives,
compiling a list of suspects.

67
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,059
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

68
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,379
There's not long
to formulate our response.

69
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,620
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

70
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,019
Page one, that's not happening.

71
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,420
Of course.

72
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,940
Absolutely, sir.

73
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,860
Well, have we established a dialogue
with this...?

74
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:22,099
We can't. There's no
e-mail address, no code word.

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
No channel for negotiation.

76
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:27,779
So we focus on finding Susannah.
We get her back.

77
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,739
However it's done, I don't care.
We stop this now.

78
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,059
Everyone's working towards this.

79
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,979
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

80
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,899
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

81
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,819
This only exists in this room.

82
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,940
It's already outside it.

83
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,779
If there are hacks sniffing around,

84
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,219
Super fucking Godzilla injunction
with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

85
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,100
This video came from YouTube.

86
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,819
What?

87
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,659
It was uploaded via an encrypted IP
an hour ago.

88
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Well, get it off there!

89
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:12,619
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

90
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,059
Spread?
How many people have seen this?

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,819
We take down one,
six clones pop up elsewhere.

92
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,500
How many people?

93
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,780
50,000. That's our current estimate.

94
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,899
The news rooms have got it.

95
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,980
They're running this on air?

96
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,779
No. We put a type five D notice out
and they're complying.

97
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,379
For now.

98
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,180
It's trending on Twitter.

99
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:38,460
For... Fucking internet!

100
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,699
What now? What's the play book?

101
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,819
This is virgin territory,
Prime Minister.

102
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,940
There's no play book.

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,459
Princess Susannah's been kidnapped!

104
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,459
You scared the shit out of me!

105
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,540
Go to work!

106
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,699
'..And have full unsimulated
sexual intercourse with a pig.'

107
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,699
No way. It's a piss take, man.
Look at it!

108
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,140

111

How do we describe it?
"An indecent act"?

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,499
Everyone's seen the video.
They know the details.

113
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,019
If we mention bestiality
Ofcom would be pissed off.

114
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,780
Fuck Ofcom!

115
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,379
We're observing the D Notice.

116
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,740
Surely we're going to do something.

117
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,899
The voluntary D Notice!

118
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,299
It may be a sportsman-like gesture but we are making it.
A woman's life is at stake!

119
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,379
My timeline consists of viewers asking why
we're not covering it. How do I reply?

120
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,819
You don't.

121
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,379
Not the Beeb, not Sky.
That is totally backwards.

122
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,859
Facebook's coverage
is pretty comprehensive!

123
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,379
It's like 9/11's happening and

124
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,460
We're not a chat room!

125
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,739
It's on CNN and Fox.

126
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,699
And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK...

127

God! This planet!

128
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,660
OK, Sarah, cover the snatch itself.

129
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,499
Simon, set tone with Standards.

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,899
We need to explain this without
viewers sicking up their Weetabix.

131
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,059
Ken, the internet, new paradigm,
Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,979
Dan, all graphics run past me.
Functional... no Peppa Pigs.

Malaika,
update the princess obit VT.

134
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,580
First, an awkward phone call.
Least I can do is warn Tom.

135
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,218
We put a D Notice on it.

136
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,340
'It's gone global, Tom.'

137
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,619
Don't. I'm begging you.

138
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,619
Don't run it, Martin.

139
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,059
'Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you.'

140
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,939
You know how much help
you're getting hereon in?

141
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,099
Shove it up your arse you fucking...

142
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,779
Interesting.

143
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,458
A man.

144
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,380
Man?

145
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:19,299
A man!

146
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,660
Tom, so you're across it...

147
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,620
'I briefed Callett.'

148
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,220
Mr Callett.
Noel, from Blue Eye.

149
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,698
Sea Of Tranquillity.

150
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,740
You won't find better.

151
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,499
Can you map a head onto a body live?

152
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,740
Depends if your camera's moving.

153
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:51,059
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

154
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,059
Yeah, Gonzo style.
He knows his shit. That's tough.

155
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,539
"Fruition to be transmitted
in full"?

156
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,300
Focus on the visuals. Different face
mapped onto a live performer.

157
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,340
Fringes of possibility...

158
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:09,459
Deadline's at four. We need to know
if it's workable by two.

159
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,780
Can't happen.

160
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,699
It has to.

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,619
Our embeds have ruled out the major
players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

162
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,859
This is what's left...
radicals, hate groups.

163
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,859
People who've threatened yourself
or the royals.

For more than questioning, I hope.

166

Nothing. Must be a hoax.

167
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,179

It was a singular "you", ie me.

Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

Anyway, we also know
it was uploaded at 3.16am.

I ran a nationwide traceback

Yeah. Closed 2010.

No.

beforehand.

utterly destroyed.

'I trust this will bring about the
safe return of Princess Susannah.'

483
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,540
'I...

484
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,220
'I love my wife.'

485
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,100
'May God forgive me.'

486
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,059
No!

487
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,780
Jesus! Poor bastard!

488
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,219
But it's been on for nearly an hour.

489
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,580
It's history, this.

490
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,019
We've got her. Susannah.

491
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,940
They released her?

492
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:55,300
Stumbling about in the city.

493
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,659
Not hers. DNA shows it's male.

494
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,260
What?

495
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,219
It seems he let her go
30 minutes before it happened.

496
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,020
Why?

497
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,459
So it's a statement.

498
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,580
That's what this was all about,
making a point.

499
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,780
Should we...?

500
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:29,219
Lose that page of the report.

501
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,419
No-one sees it, especially the PM.

502
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
Of course.

503
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,059
Good news, Michael.

504
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,739
You saved her.
Susannah's alive and well.
